- **🔗 Web3 Agent**: Blockchain transactions, wallet management, and DeFi portfolio analysis
- **🌐 Web Scraping Agent**: Real-time market data collection for stocks and cryptocurrencies

### Core Capabilities

- **AI Models**: Uses Hugging Face models for text generation, sentiment analysis, and expense categorization
- **Automated Scheduling**: Scheduled tasks for reports, alerts, and data collection
- **Database Management**: SQLite database for persistent storage
- **Real-time Analysis**: Live market data and portfolio performance tracking
- **No API Keys Required**: Uses open-source models that download automatically

## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager
- Git

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd financial-system
```

2. **Create a virtual environment (recommended)**
```bash
python -m venv venv

# On Windows
venv\Scripts\activate

# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. **Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Note**: The first run will download AI models from Hugging Face (approximately 500MB-1GB). This is a one-time download.

## 🎯 Quick Start

### Run the Demo

```bash
python financial_system.py demo
```

This will run a comprehensive demonstration showcasing all system capabilities.

### Interactive Mode

```bash
python financial_system.py
```

This starts the system in interactive mode where you can manually execute commands.

## 📖 Usage Examples

### As a Python Module

```python
from financial_system import MultiAgentSystem

# Initialize the system
system = MultiAgentSystem()
system.start_system()

# Create a transaction
result = system.process_command('create_transaction', {
    'type': 'expense',
    'amount': 150.50,
    'description': 'Grocery shopping',
    'account_id': 'checking_001'
})

# Generate financial report
report = system.process_command('financial_report')
print(f"Total Income: ${report['result']['summary']['total_income']}")

# Calculate mortgage payment
mortgage = system.process_command('calculate_mortgage', {
    'principal': 300000,
    'rate': 4.5,
    'years': 30
})
print(f"Monthly Payment: ${mortgage['result']['monthly_payment']}")

# Stop the system
system.stop_system()
```

## 📊 Database Schema

### Transactions Table
- `id`: Unique transaction ID
- `type`: income/expense
- `amount`: Transaction amount
- `category`: Auto-categorized by AI
- `timestamp`: Transaction time
- `account_id`: Associated account

### Inventory Table
- `id`: Item ID
- `name`: Item name
- `quantity`: Current stock
- `unit_price`: Price per unit
- `minimum_stock`: Low stock threshold

### Loan Applications Table
- `id`: Application ID
- `applicant_name`: Applicant name
- `loan_amount`: Requested amount
- `credit_score`: Credit score
- `status`: pending/approved/rejected
- `risk_assessment`: AI risk analysis

## 🔧 Configuration

### AI Models
The system automatically downloads models on first run. To use different models, modify the model names in `AIModelManager.load_models()`.

### Database
By default, uses SQLite with `financial_system.db`. To change:
```python
db_manager = DatabaseManager(db_path="your_database.db")
```

### Scheduled Tasks
Modify scheduling in `TaskScheduler.start()`:
```python
schedule.every().hour.do(self._scrape_market_data)
schedule.every().day.at("09:00").do(self._generate_daily_reports)
```

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- **Private Keys**: The system generates wallet private keys. In production, these should be encrypted.
- **Database**: Consider using encrypted SQLite or migrate to a secure database system.
- **API Endpoints**: When exposing as API, implement proper authentication.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Model Download Fails**
   - Check internet connection
   - Ensure sufficient disk space (1-2GB)
   - Try manual download from Hugging Face

2. **Import Errors**
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Check Python version (3.8+)

3. **Database Errors**
   - Ensure write permissions in the directory
   - Delete `financial_system.db` to reset

### Logging
The system uses Python logging. To increase verbosity:
```python
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```

## 📈 Performance Tips

- **Model Loading**: Models are loaded once at startup. For faster startup, comment out unused models.
- **Database**: For better performance with large datasets, consider PostgreSQL.
- **Scheduling**: Adjust task frequencies based on your needs.
