# Deployment Guide - Hugging Face Spaces

This guide will help you deploy your AI Automation System to Hugging Face Spaces.

## 🚀 Quick Deployment

### 1. Prepare Your Repository

Make sure your repository contains:
- ✅ `package.json` with build scripts
- ✅ `vite.config.ts` for Vite configuration
- ✅ `README.md` with Hugging Face Spaces metadata
- ✅ `.gitignore` to exclude unnecessary files
- ✅ All source code in the `src/` directory

### 2. Create a Hugging Face Space

1. Go to [Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces)
2. Click "Create new Space"
3. Choose your repository: `CHKIM79/ai-automation-system`
4. Select **SDK**: `Static`
5. Select **License**: `MIT`
6. Click "Create Space"

### 3. Configure the Space

The Space will automatically:
- Detect your React/Vite application
- Install dependencies from `package.json`
- Run the build command: `npm run build`
- Serve static files from the `dist/` directory

### 4. Custom Build Configuration (Optional)

If you need custom build settings, create a `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file:

```yaml
name: Deploy to Hugging Face Spaces

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run build
      - name: Upload build artifacts
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: build-files
          path: dist/
```
